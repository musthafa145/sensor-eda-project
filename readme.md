# 📊 Sensor EDA Project  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project ingests raw sensor data (CSV format) and performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The goal is to understand the dataset by computing descriptive statistics, identifying data quality issues, and visualizing trends.

## ⚙️ Features (EDA Steps Implemented)  
1. Dataset preview (head & tail).  
2. Dataset info (rows, columns, datatypes).  
3. Missing value detection.  
4. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, std).  
5. Unique values for categorical features.  
6. Correlation analysis for numeric features.  
7. Outlier detection (basic visualizations).  
8. Time-series trend analysis (if timestamp is present).  
9. Sensor-to-sensor comparisons.  
10. Final summary of insights & recommendations.

## 🛠 Installation  

Clone this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/musthafa145/sensor-eda-project.git
cd sensor-eda-project
````

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the pipeline on your dataset:

```bash
python src/main.py data/dataset.csv
```

Example output includes:

* Summary statistics
* Correlation heatmap
* Distribution plots
* Time-series trend visualization

---

## 📈 Example Outputs

* **Statistics**: Mean, Min, Max per sensor
* **Plots**: Histograms, Boxplots, Line plots over time
* **Correlations**: Heatmap to show relationships between sensors

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Automate EDA reports into HTML/PDF.
* Add anomaly detection module.
* Enable CI/CD integration for continuous analysis.
